Here, we're going to showcase some of the worst practice of companies, developers or events, so other developers would be aware of what's going on.

## 📜 Rules : 
* An entry must be severely motivated, as a developer making an error of syntax is not enough, but sexual harassment is
* It doesn't have to be a single event in your experience, but more like something that was repetitive or an issue that was never addressed even after multiple alerts
* If the practices changes, suggest sources and create an [issue](https://github.com/OverCodeTech/dev-job-blacklist/issues)
* Anyone can submit a new entry as an [issue](https://github.com/OverCodeTech/dev-job-blacklist/issues)
